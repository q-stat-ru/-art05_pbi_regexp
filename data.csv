CGxAMPmByJp,"On the recommendation of @madnart, we went to the White Lion Park. Its cool there. I managed to shoot a lot of material. This post is only about lions, but there are many other animals, I will post them later. #belylev #lion #safari"
CGgPnJthGv2,"Yesterday we visited the safari park again, this time in the park of lions. The lions themselves did not particularly want to pose, but the lynxes and the small inhabitants did. It seems to me that this is one of the best places for photographing and observing animals and I am glad that we have it here in Primorye. #safari #zoo #primorie"

BtKc2_MhNB3,"Ice skating on the sea is an entertainment available in a small number of cities, but there are many opportunities for this in Vladivostok. We covered 6 km in an hour, 3 of them against a strong wind. #sea #skatingrink #nature #sunset #rink"
Bskz7slBCsu,"Today I finally managed to visit the Shkotovsky safari park. To be honest, I liked it more than in foreign safaris and zoos, which I had to visit. Here you can see the animals much better and its easy to catch good shots. We went on two out of three excursions. Well go to the lions next time. #animals #beast #leopard #tiger #safari #zoo #shkotovosafaripark"

BnDziJZAmYg,"The lagoon is quiet - it got a little dark and the entire surface became mirrored. Gliding on such a smooth surface on a glanders, practically leaving no ripples, is a special pleasure, sorry I didnt shoot a video, some other time. #tourism #lagoon #evening #travel #sea #sunset #russia"
BnCqK2pgT7d,"A river in flood is a very interesting sight, yes, the water is muddy, but the trees immersed in the water to the very crowns leave the impression of being in some forests of the Amazon, when you swim through this vegetation and do not know what can emerge in a couple of meters and there is whether in general an exit into the river itself. #tourism # water # travel tourist #river #travel #water #russia #vladivostok"
Bm-iSsRAeK9,"39.36 km in 8 hours - the Suifun River aka Razdolnaya was passed. Not to say that it was very difficult, but an easy walk downstream did not work either. Especially when, in the middle of the way, one kilometer against a strong wind was raked out in 40 minutes and had to make an unplanned halt to recuperate. Then the wind became weaker and it turned out to return to a normal pace. The sensations are not at all the same as getting caught in the sea, the trip was definitely worth it. #suppsurfing #sea #hike #travel #rafting #sup #supsurf #tourist #river # tourism"
